# Waiting on Tanner

Things the game is blocked on until the owner does or decides them. Agents add an item here when work stops on the owner, and remove it once it is done. Newest first.

## To do

- [ ] **Turn on device emulation so agents can test on an Android emulator (and iOS Simulator).** This lets an agent check the installed app's ROTATE toggle and test touch, portrait, and the PWA on real mobile browsers, without your phone.
  1. In T3 Code, turn on device access for this environment (the setting that lets agents use the Device panel; today agents get "Agent device access is turned off for this environment").
  2. Reply "OK to install the Android SDK" (about 6 to 8 GB). An agent then runs `brew install --cask android-commandlinetools` and installs a Pixel system image with Google Play Chrome and an emulator through `sdkmanager`, and creates the device. Nothing else on the Mac changes.
  3. Optional, for iOS: install Xcode from the App Store (about 10+ GB) and open it once to accept the license, so the iOS Simulator is available too.
